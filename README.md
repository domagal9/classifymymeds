# CoverMyMeds Challenge at The Erdos Institute 2021 Boot Camp

## Description

When a patient try to get a prescription from a pharmacy, a claim is created against the patient's insurance. Such a pharmacy claim might be rejected for various reasons and might require a prior authorization (PA). In this project, we surveyed many classifiers for predicting how likely a certain PA will be approved, and forecast future volume of PAs with time series analysis techniques.
